# userstyles-chat.google.com-dark
Dark theme for chat.google.com

I would put this on userstyles if the website would load. 

This css is free for anyone to use, modify and improve with PRs.

Its not a super dark theme but its dark. Uses a lot of #333 with #eee and has a light blue to it, i think it flows.
Using the Stylus browser extension you should be able to drop the css data into a new style for the chat.google.com domain and be done.

# TODO
* adjust the title bar to be dark
